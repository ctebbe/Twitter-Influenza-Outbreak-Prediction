Instructions on how to run the program:
1. Divide the ili.csv file into "ilitrain.csv" and "ilitest.csv". Say all 2015 year records are placed into ilitest.csv and the rest of the records in ilitrain.csv
2. Place the files arx.py, ilitrain.csv and ilitest.csv in a folder. 
3. Navigate to the folder in which the files are present and run the command "ipython arx.py"
4. Results are shown in the console and the graph will be saved to the same folder.
